# Plenary-Speeches
Files related to collecting, cleaning and adjusting files for plenary speeches should be  here

### Crawling

We wrote crawlers for the following countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Norway, Romania, Finland, Greece).
The all crawlers except Greece are written with the scrapy library and are located in the _spiders_ subfolder. 
They are run with the following command: "python scrapy crawl \<country\>" from the ./eia_crawling directory).
The crawler for Greece is an exectuable scripts located in the _non-scrapy-spiders_ subfolder.

### Preprocessing (folder _preprocessing_)

The subfolder contains scripts to preprocess third-party data.
The following list contains the scripts that need to be run per country:
- Cyprus
    1.  ocr_cyprus.py  # Transform raw .pdf data to .txt
    2.  preprocess_cyprus.py # Split the .txt data per session (all sessions within a legislation are concatenated)
- Czechia, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Netherland:
    -   preprocess_parlamint.py \<country\> <iso2countrycode> # e.g. preprocess_parlamint.py italy IT
- Latvia, Slovenia, Spain:
    -   preprocess_parlamint_flat.py \<country\> <iso2countrycode>
- Croatia, Poland, Slovenia (additionally run):
    -   preprocess_\<country\>.py # In those cases, we use multiple third party sources
- EP:
    1.  load_talk_of_europe.py # Query speech data from the "talk of europe" database
    2.  load_talk_of_europe_written_flag.py # Query whether the retrieved text is written or spoken (splitting the two information was required due to time outs on the server side)
    3.  preprocess_talk_of_europe.py
    4.  preprocess_ep_speeches.py # Preprocesses our crawled data based on an existing scrip
 
### First postprocessing (subfolder _postprocessing_)
The subfolder contains an EP parliament specific postprocessing. This is required to split the EP speech data in lanugage specific chunks for the sentence splitting.
Run: "python postprocess_ep_speeches.py"

### Parsing (folder _parsing_)
The subfolder contains all country specific parsing scripts. 
Run parse_national.py for the respective country (run "python -m eia_crawling.parsing.parse_national \<country\>" from ./eia-crawling/ directory)

### Corpus creation and sentence splitting (_party_positioning_ subfolder):
Create the national corpus and split it on the sentence level run:
"python -m party_positioning.create_national_corpus \<country\>" from ./eia-crawling/ directory, ATTENTION: GPU required)

The only exception to this process is the EP speech data. We need to pass each language chunk create by postprocess_ep_speeches.py through the sentence splitting.
Run: "python -m party_positioning.create_national_corpus ep \<language_code\>"


### Second postprocessing (folder _postprocessing_)
In this step, we run country specific postprocessing to clean the data.
Run postprocessing_\<country\>.py for the respective country (if it exists) (run: "python eia-crawling/party_positioning/postprocessing/postprocessing_\<country\>.py")

For most of the countries, we keep the following files:
- \<country\>_corpus_2009_2019_raw.csv # File prior to postprocessing
- \<country\>_corpus_2009_2019.csv # File after postprocessing
